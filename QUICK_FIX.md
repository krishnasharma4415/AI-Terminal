# Quick Fix for AI Commands

## Issue
The AI is generating commands with markdown formatting that needs to be cleaned up.

## Solution
The AI command parsing has been updated in the code, but the server needs to be restarted to pick up the changes.

## Steps to Fix

1. **Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal where python app.py is running)

2. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   $env:GOOGLE_API_KEY = "AIzaSyCqvyA-xygJVM9bKEGDzDoThBgv4WyueCk"
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Test the AI commands**:
   - "list all files"
   - "show me python files"
   - "count the files" (after listing files)

## Alternative: Use Built-in Commands
While we fix the AI parsing, you can use these equivalent commands:

- "list all files" → `ls`
- "show me python files" → `ls *.py`
- "count files" → `ls | wc -l`
- "show current directory" → `pwd`
- "create a folder" → `mkdir folder_name`

## All Other Features Work Perfectly
- ✅ Multi-tab support
- ✅ Command history with Ctrl+R
- ✅ Advanced autocomplete
- ✅ Session context
- ✅ All built-in commands
- ✅ System monitoring
